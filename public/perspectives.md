#This is a collection of perspectives

I've aimed to live my life with no regrets but I kept finding myself in a world of darkness.  At first, I tried being the person I thought others wouldn't reject but that just resulted in a clash of different versions of me when the groups overlapped.  My new strategy involved running social encounter thought experiments to help me identify scenarios that would make me appear anything but just and kind; unfortunately, this only trained me to never ask for help and then came the slowly creeping darkness.  I didn't even notice until it enveloped me like a warm blanket in a cold world.  It convinced me that being alone offers safety so I proceeded to sacrifice any part of myself that endangered predictability.  This social deprivation created a suffocating void that plunged me into great depths of depression.

I found solace in movies and television, immersing myself into various worlds and empathizing with different characters each time I rewatched them.  With each viewing, I searched for subtleties I had previously missed or overlooked.  In the beginning of this journey, I think I was looking for patterns of good behavior to imitate.  What I discovered, much later, is that action is pointless without motive and motive is meaningless without experience.  Life requires an endless cycle involving trial and error, using your own experience as a foundation.  This journey is not linear and it's complexity makes transference difficult.  I believe this is why storytelling is so important.  Humans can only empathize and adapt from a place of familiarity.  If we are too far removed from something it makes the journey to understanding appear scary and generates fear.  This fear, instinctually, leads to fight or flight; both paths reject understanding.  One would either fight for the familiar or flee to avoid the proposed reality.  When faced with these challenges, we need trusted elders to provide a bridge that can lead to understanding.

A fair and open society should not condone the silencing of narrative perspectives from an administrative position.  The value of such arts can naturally be discovered through exploration; if it lacks necessary merit, it will simply be forgotten.

I think I can write a book on philosophic parenting.

I feel like my life is the reverse of all my father's demons; perhaps better, I feel I am performing atonement for his previous actions.  Don't get me wrong, I love the man to death and he was a great person.  We're all just humans at the end of the day.

We become parents so we can re-experience life at an older age.  Your perspective on any situation can be enhanced by the addition of children.  It also makes us better, wiser people.  Also, as parents, we have a responsibility to protect the process of children learning.  There should always be a diverse curriculum and literature should not be allowed to be banned.

The father's haunt their sons, as the sons haunt their father's.

As a righteous human, we must establish noble morals early and be ardent not to waver.  This morals are yours and they are your guiding light on this arduous journey through life.  They must absorb the best of what you see in others and, at times, the best in what you see in yourself.

We should be cognizant by which we prioritize our actions.  We must be willing to adjust our priorities for other's benefit.  This is the fundamental way we advance as a society.  Just like a great artist, we must put the right things into perspective.

Look for what you know isn't there.  Find yourself in others and never stop looking.

What if a top content streamer had a video effect that made it appear they were a.i. with small defects to signal to the live audience they may be simulations.  The on-demand video would not have this added effect so as to isolate the live viewers.  Then the streamer would go dark on any social media and allow the confusion to intensify.  If handled correctly, it should be a perfect scenario for group discussion and learning.

I want to write a book about an I.T. Engineer that fights evil and gains special powers that allow him to clearly see the best solution to all problems.  Like a decentralized single signon block chain allowing access to all services created as a true and honest collaboration with all companies and governments with full transparency with the public.

I want to write a book where participants are resurrected by the brother of a property owner.  The party is not complete without living friends and other guests who may or may not be aware of the truth about the mysterious guests.  Each game is recorded by a highly-advanced surveillance system which has an unknown a.i. at it's core.  The players are are real actors that are possessed.
