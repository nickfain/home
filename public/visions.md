Web2 is the UI to web3.  Create a web2 site that presents a UI that customizes a web3 backend for a user's account.  Creation can just use an email address and later can be linked to a wallet.  From web2 you can add-in other toolbox-like connections, authenticated via wallet, for decentralized services like SMS notifications, social apps, news sites, etc.  There would likely be default services like ENS, system messages, IPFS, IPNS, or others that may be considered fundamental.  This web2 interface would begin by first creating a development view that can then have layered views of varying complexity may be used based on the user's knowledge or experience.  Beginners would likely have a drag and drop, no-code approach.  Throughout development, features are added and presented to users based on the interface complexity template used or a customized one.  User's can create functions using any of the integrations to facilitate automations.  Standardizations would exist to abstract common activities like 2-way communication for data like name, email, wallet addresses, certain account history, etc.

Create a simple movie rating system that can "piggyback" on IMDb.  This would represent a more honest reception of the movie as experienced by the viewer.  It could be as simple as 3 emojis the viewer associates with the movie and an optional comment.  For the movie's rating, it would show the top emojis and perhaps additional statistics based on the user's overall review.  The comment could be shown plainly or have an LLM process it to mitigate spoilers and perhaps other functions.  If blockchain anchors evolve as I expect, they can be used for authentication and other references that point to data stored in a public chain, likely an L2 for blob storage.  As a user, you could tag reviews or reviewers you like and include additional metadata,  setup your own webhooks or notification path, or you could even configure an anchor that allows your public-facing data to flow into a unified public profile.  The profile, while public, still has access permissions to only allow those you permit; these permissions could be direct assignment or based on a ruleset to permit groups of people.

Everyone can have a DAO that funds them to be who they want to be and achieve their detailed dreams for the future.  The funds are distributed to you based on your success being the person you aim to be.  If the DAO determines you haven't achieved certain goals in a given time period, the funds can be re-routed based on predetermined rules and dispersed appropriately.  You can then start a new character and begin again.  If you're successful, you design your own quests or choose from community of curated quests that can have dynamic content and can have significant funding via a special wallet which can receive transfers from the DAO.  The wallet authenticates at random intervals and can be optionally locked if a future compromise is expected.  Reactivation is trivial to true owner and quite a quandary for would-be thieves.

I need to write to .CORE L2 Team about Truth in Development.  Have a team responsible for assigning metadata to blocks of internal information.  This data can be injested into an internal LLM that can then present this information to the public, to investors, or business partners.  The information shared is based on rules configured to define the relationship that exists with the external entity.  Like choosing to not share what's in the development pipeline that's more than 12 months out.  This method of sharing will not only tell you information the company has shared but it also lists topics or classifications of information, by title only, they have chosen not to share.

A Forum where posts can only be responded with a mini-app that represents the responder's LLM-simulation of himself with an additional contextual perspective related to the parent topic.
The app itself is processed before or after posting, to allow flexibility and can optionally offer decentralized processing.  Post-processing, the app is a multi-dimensional media which could be experienced as static text, a generated gif which may be an animation that tells a story, or even be a VR game or world that can provide an interactive experience.  All of the media provided is shaped by the person who trained an LLM that represents an honest expression of themselves.  As a guest to this experience, you are almost able to see through their eyes.

Use chatgpt to "anonymize" a user's message by mitigating a person's writing habits from being deciphered.  A messaging platform for anonymous feedback.
---------
AR glasses that create an overlay for a TV/pc monitor.  Content shown on the monitor is identical for all and the glasses customize the experience.  This overlay can be used to customize live content, i.e. a hud tracking/displaying stats for an activity such as a front-line worker.  

This can also be used to show a curated quest with activities and rewards which can be physical or digital.
---------
Send messages to people which they will receive later, once they create their profile.  Send thanks or feedback to a person based on information provided about that person or other details about the "event".  False positives could be corrected by recipients by providing incentive to assist in good faith.  

Ai should be able to achieve this in the future while maintaining privacy.

Possible web2->web3 bridge of information

Web2 sites host the initial content posting, like a news article.  The initial host agrees to the content being shared/reshared and then a consumer agrees to host.  The content is then transitioned to the consumers block chain or via IPFS content the user supports.  The content can then be additionally backed by other users to improve accessibility.  This should permit a method that allows the bandwidth usage to be distributed to all that have agreed to host specific content.
